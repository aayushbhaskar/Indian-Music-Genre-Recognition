# Indian-Music-Genre-Recognition
This project is a take at the music genre recognition using machine learning, aimed at Indian music genres. The dataset used for the project
was collected from various sources, and made into 30s .wav clips for training. They were converted into feature vectors uisng Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) method. Finally the model was trained using ANN, so that it could differentiate between various genres like Bolly Pop, Sufi,
 Ghazal, Carnatic and Hindustani Classical. You can access the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/winchester19/indian-music-genre-dataset.
